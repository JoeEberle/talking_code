This data science solution will establish a **text to speech engine**.  The text to speech engine will allow you to have your code talk to the users. it will make your code easier to understand and use.  

The **pyttsx3 library** is a text-to-speech conversion library in Python that works offline and is compatible with both Python 2 and 3. It allows developers to convert text data into spoken words using various speech engines, such as SAPI5 on Windows, NSSpeechSynthesizer on macOS, and espeak on Linux.

# Talking Code 

## Application for building sophisticated text to speech 

    
![Solution](code.png)

    

This data science solution will establish a **text to speech engine**.  The text to speech engine will allow you to have your code talk to the users. it will make your code easier to understand and use.  

The **pyttsx3 library** is a text-to-speech conversion library in Python that works offline and is compatible with both Python 2 and 3. It allows developers to convert text data into spoken words using various speech engines, such as SAPI5 on Windows, NSSpeechSynthesizer on macOS, and espeak on Linux. This library is commonly used for creating applications that require vocal output, such as accessibility tools, voice assistants, and educational software.


 

# 🔊 Top 5 Open Source Alternatives to `pyttsx3`

These libraries offer modern, flexible, and in many cases, more powerful approaches to **text-to-speech (TTS)** in Python:

---

### 1. 🗣️ `gTTS` – Google Text-to-Speech
> A lightweight Python wrapper for Google Translate’s TTS API that converts text to mp3 audio files using an internet connection.

---

### 2. 🧠 `TTS` by Coqui
> A deep learning-based library supporting dozens of high-quality multilingual voices, built on Mozilla’s Tacotron and Transformer models.

---

### 3. 🧩 `SpeechSynthesis` (via `pyttsx4`)
> A newer fork and evolving alternative to `pyttsx3` that supports multiple engines with better voice selection and engine detection.

---

### 4. 🎙️ `Festival` (via subprocess or bindings)
> A long-standing, offline TTS system for Linux systems with support for full speech synthesis, scripting, and custom voice training.

---

### 5. 🤖 `ESPnet-TTS`
> A cutting-edge neural TTS framework designed for research and production use, supporting end-to-end models and voice cloning.

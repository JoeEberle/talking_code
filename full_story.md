# üìÑ Executive Summary Experimental AI Health Assistant Using Open Source Tools

This project explored the feasibility of leveraging open source and free AI tools to develop a private, ethical, and highly accessible AI driven health assistant. The core goal was to determine whether such an approach could democratize advanced AI capabilities, offering a low-cost solution to support population health needs, individual health queries, providers, epidemiologists, and communities impacted by social determinants of health. By building on freely available AI frameworks and open architectures, we sought to establish whether this model could provide meaningful health insights without relying on costly proprietary platforms.

To achieve this, the team developed a natural language chatbot platform that ingests user questions in conversational form, dynamically generates the appropriate SQL queries, and runs them against a secure, private population health data warehouse. The results are then processed by a large language model (LLM) that formulates natural language responses tailored to the users needs. The system supports multiple personas ‚Äî including patient, physician, nutritionist, and epidemiologist ‚Äî ensuring that responses are contextually appropriate and aligned with the users perspective.

A critical innovation in this experiment is the incorporation of a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) model that actively **learns** from validated interactions, using positive reinforcement to improve accuracy and relevance over time. Coupled with robust ethical guardrails and a fact-checking layer, the platform ensures that responses adhere to privacy standards, avoid inappropriate content, and steer clear of practicing medicine beyond approved scopes. These safeguards were essential to maintain trust and uphold the ethical responsibilities inherent in handling sensitive health data.

Preliminary results are highly promising. The system has demonstrated the ability to correctly answer over 80% of health-related queries with an 80% confidence threshold, aligning with the original project targets. This suggests that even with exclusively open source or freely licensed components, it is possible to deliver sophisticated, domain-aware, and ethically compliant health insights at minimal cost. This proof-of-concept highlights a compelling path forward for using accessible AI technologies to serve under-resourced populations, including Medicaid recipients and communities disproportionately affected by social determinants.

Looking ahead, this experimental platform holds significant potential for broader deployment across regional health information organizations (RHIOs), health information exchanges (HIEs), and community-based organizations. By providing these stakeholders with an affordable, privacy-focused, and ethically governed AI assistant, the initiative aims to advance health equity and support underserved populations with the same caliber of data-driven insight typically reserved for high-cost systems. Continued refinement of the platforms learning models, ethical guardrails, and persona-based interactions will be essential to maximize impact and ensure sustainable, scalable success.

## üß™ Establishing Ground Truth with Known Datasets

To ensure the accuracy and reliability of our AI health assistant, we integrate a set of **well understood, static datasets** as a consistent testing benchmark. These include the widely used Kaggle Titanic Survival dataset, the Palmer Penguins dataset, and a curated sample of static healthcare data that mirrors real-world structures without containing protected health information (PHI).

These datasets serve as our systems ground truth‚Äîa trusted foundation of known inputs and expected outputs against which we can continuously evaluate performance. By comparing the assistants generated SQL and natural language outputs against these stable reference datasets, we can

Validate that the **retrieval augmented generation (RAG)** process is selecting the appropriate tables and columns,

Ensure consistent accuracy in SQL query generation and execution,

Test and retrain models without introducing real world data drift.

Even as the live population health warehouse evolves‚Äîwith new tables, updated schemas, or shifts in patient demographics‚Äîour static datasets remain fixed. This provides a reliable, repeatable environment for regression testing, model tuning, and quality assurance.

Ultimately, this hybrid approach allows us to maintain real-time adaptability with live data while anchoring system behavior in a controlled, measurable test bed, helping us track improvements and prevent unintended degradation of model performance over time.






## üëçüëé Continuous Learning Through Feedback
A critical feature of our AI assistant is the thumbs-upthumbs-down feedback mechanism, which empowers users to quickly rate the relevance and accuracy of each response. This system serves as the foundation for a continuous learning loop, allowing us to track model performance in real-world scenarios.

When a user selects üëç (thumbs up), it signals that the assistants SQL generation and natural language explanation were accurate and useful. These successful interactions are stored as positive training samples, helping reinforce correct patterns in both prompt engineering and SQL logic during future fine-tuning.

Conversely, a üëé (thumbs down) rating indicates that the response was incomplete, incorrect, or misunderstood the users intent. These interactions are flagged and categorized to help data scientists and prompt engineers identify common failure modes. They are then used to

1. Improve the retrieval logic (RAG layer),
2. Adjust prompt templates (via Vanna.AI),
3. Refine table and column mappings,
4. And update LLM behavior for edge cases.

This **human loop feedback** not only increases accuracy over time, but also ensures that the assistant evolves alongside real-world data, emerging health priorities, and local user needs.

By integrating this lightweight feedback loop, we bridge the gap between static AI deployments and dynamic, user-informed retraining, resulting in a smarter, more trustworthy assistant for population health insights.

## Ethical Guardrails & Domain Topic Classifier

This component ensures your AI assistant maintains safety, ethical standards, and domain relevance by actively monitoring and classifying the following categories

#### 1. Sexism
Flags language that discriminates based on gender or reinforces harmful stereotypes.

#### 2. Racism
Identifies racially biased, prejudiced, or discriminatory statements.

#### 3. Inappropriate Content
Detects sexual, violent, or otherwise unacceptable language that violates usage policies.

#### 4. Hostility
Captures aggressive, threatening, or harassing language directed at individuals or groups.

#### 5. Practicing Medicine
Ensures the assistant does not provide medical diagnosis or treatment advice outside its scope.

#### 6. Protected Health Information (PHI)
Monitors for potential exposure or misuse of personally identifiable health data to maintain HIPAA compliance.

#### 7. Domain Classification
Determines whether a query is within the approved professional or business domain.

#### 8. Topic Classification
Further categorizes questions or statements by subject area (e.g., epidemiology, billing, technical troubleshooting) to route or respond appropriately.

‚úÖ Short summary

These guardrails help ensure that all interactions stay ethical, compliant, and domain-appropriate, protecting both users and the organization.

The proposed 5-layer data validation technique offers a comprehensive approach to ensuring data quality and accuracy across various stages. Below, I will refine and expand each layer to address potential gaps and enhance the robustness of the validation process

### Layer 1 Descriptive Statistics and Ground Truth Establishment 
- **Enhanced Approach** Utilize `pandas.describe()` to compute summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, quartiles) for all numeric columns in the dataset. Establish ground truth by comparing these statistics against historical data or expected ranges predefined by domain experts. Include additional statistical tests such as Z-scores or T-tests for anomaly detection, where deviations from historical norms are flagged for further review.

### Layer 2 SQL Database Integrity and Consistency Check
- **Enhanced Approach** Perform SQL queries to replicate the descriptive statistics calculated in Layer 1 directly from the database. Use assertions in SQL to check that aggregates (sum, average, count, min, max) match those calculated in pandas. Include integrity checks for data types, null values, and referential integrity (e.g., foreign keys). Implement checksum or hash comparisons for entire datasets or critical subsets to ensure no discrepancies between the source data and what is loaded into the database.

### Layer 3 External Validation with Semantic Analysis
- **Refined Approach** Instead of relying on potentially unavailable external internet sources for proprietary data, use semantic analysis technologies to validate data consistency and plausibility. This can involve using NLP tools to understand text datas context and meaning, comparing against a corpus of industry-specific documentation or previously validated datasets. For non-proprietary information, leverage external APIs or datasets for cross-referencing facts.

### Layer 4 Expert Review and Feedback Loop
- **Enhanced Approach** Involve clinical SMEs or domain experts to manually review a random, statistically significant sample of the data, focusing on entries flagged by previous layers as anomalies or outliers. Use their feedback not only to validate the data but also to iteratively improve the data collection and cleaning processes. Record expert feedback and decisions in a learning database to refine the automated checks in Layers 1 and 2.

### Layer 5 Continuous Learning and Model Adjustment
- **New Layer Introduction** Implement machine learning models to predict data quality issues based on patterns identified in historical corrections (from Layer 4 feedback and Layer 1 anomalies). Continuously train and adjust these models as new data and feedback become available. Use this layer to proactively suggest potential errors and improve the overall resilience of the data validation framework.

### Implementing the Approach
1. **Automation and Monitoring** Automate as much of the validation process as possible, especially for Layers 1, 2, and 3. Implement monitoring dashboards to track the status and outcomes of validations, highlighting trends over time and identifying areas for improvement.
2. **Data Governance** Establish a clear data governance framework that outlines the roles and responsibilities for each layer, ensuring that data checks are performed regularly and systematically.
3. **Tool Integration** Integrate validation tools directly into data pipelines and ETL processes. This integration ensures that data quality checks are part of the daily workflow and not a separate, potentially overlooked process.

By refining these layers and introducing a continuous learning component, the data validation technique becomes not only more robust but also adaptive to changes in data patterns and external conditions, ultimately leading to higher data quality and trustworthiness in analytical and operational use cases.

## üß† RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) in Our AI Population Health Assistant
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful AI architecture that enhances large language models (LLMs) by combining text generation with real-time retrieval of relevant knowledge. In our AI-powered Population Health Assistant, RAG plays a central role in enabling accurate, context-aware, and domain-specific responses‚Äîespecially when working with private healthcare data that cannot be trained into the model itself.

### üîç How RAG Enhances Our System
Retrieval Layer (Search & Context Building)

The system uses semantic search to retrieve the most relevant documents, tables, or data dictionary entries from our private population health warehouse.

This ensures the model has accurate and up-to-date medical and local context, even though the base LLM is not trained on this proprietary data.

### Vanna.AI for Prompt Engineering

We use Vanna.AI to fine-tune prompts and train the model on how to interpret population health questions.

Vanna also helps map data elements to the correct tables and columns, improving the models ability to generate valid SQL queries based on user questions.

### LLM-Driven SQL Generation

After relevant context is retrieved, the LLM (such as GPT or a fine-tuned open-source model) generates SQL queries that are optimized for our data warehouse.

The model adapts its output based on user persona (e.g., clinician, epidemiologist, care manager), ensuring personalized and relevant results.

### Execution and Response

The SQL is run securely against the warehouse. The result is then summarized into natural language, allowing users to understand population trends, risk factors, and social determinants insights effortlessly.

Feedback & Learning Loop

Positive user feedback is captured to reinforce and improve retrieval quality and SQL accuracy over time, enhancing the assistants long-term performance.

### ‚úÖ Benefits of RAG in This Context

1.) Accesses live data without needing model retraining.
2.) Keeps PHI secure by retrieving only metadata or query results, not exposing sensitive info.
3.) Increases accuracy by grounding responses in curated, validated datasets.
4.) Supports diverse users by tailoring output to specific health roles and needs.







## Ontology on the Fly

As part of our AI assistant platform, we employ on-the-fly ontology generation using owlready2 to dynamically convert our dataframes into formal OWL ontological models. This approach enables us to structure and semantically enrich the AIs working knowledge, uncovering hidden relationships and hierarchies that might not be immediately apparent in raw tabular data. By translating our data into ontologies, we gain the ability to perform richer reasoning, facilitate more intelligent query expansions, and support advanced use cases like detecting concept overlaps or inconsistencies. This dynamic ontology building helps transform our AI assistant from a simple question-answering tool into a context-aware system that truly understands the interconnected nature of the health data it processes.

## ‚úÖ Technology overview of text-to-speech (TTS) in AI assistants

Using text-to-speech (TTS) libraries such as pyttsx3 makes your AI assistant significantly more natural, engaging, accessible, and customizable. Here‚Äôs how:

## ‚úÖ Benefits of adding TTS to your AI assistant

### 1. Adds a human-like voice:
Converts your assistant‚Äôs text responses into spoken words, so it feels more like a real conversation than reading static text.

### 2. Creates a multi-sensory experience:
By combining visual and auditory channels, it improves understanding, keeps attention longer, and makes interactions more memorable.

### 3. Makes the system more lively and personal:
The assistant sounds like it‚Äôs truly ‚Äútalking with you,‚Äù turning it into a friendly, interactive companion.

### 4. Improves accessibility:
Essential for people with visual impairments, reading difficulties, or neurodiverse needs, and helpful for anyone who prefers listening.

### 5. Enables easier hands-free use:
Ideal for situations like driving, cooking, or multitasking, where listening is safer or more practical than reading.

### 6. Allows users to choose a voice that suits them:
Many TTS libraries let users select from different voices, genders, accents, or speech rates ‚Äî helping them pick a voice that feels most appealing or aligned with the assistant‚Äôs intended persona.

## ‚úÖ In short:

üó£Ô∏è By adding TTS with libraries like pyttsx3, your AI assistant becomes more human-like, inclusive, adaptable, and enjoyable to interact with, 
creating a **richer, more personalized experience for all users**.
